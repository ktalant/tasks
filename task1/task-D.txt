to accomplish given task:
1. get cpu usage of pods       # kubectl top pods
2. sort the cpu usage of pods  # kubectl top pods | sort -r -k2
   -r - sort reverse, from highest to lowest
   -t - sort 2nd column, in this case CPU usage
  
3. get the pod which uses cpu  # kubectl top pods | sort -r -k2 | head -n -2
   resource most
4. save the result to output   # kubectl top pods | sort -r -k2 | head -n -2 > report.txt
